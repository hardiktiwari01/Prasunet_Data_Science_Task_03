# Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to prepare the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and performing EDA to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns.

## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic. Key columns include:

- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1, 2, 3)
